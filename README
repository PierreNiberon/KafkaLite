KafkaLite is a project to simplify kafka and message streaming.

The idea is similar to what SQLite is to RDBMS in general.

To Do :
    - Refactor tests
    - Add threading
    - refactor ugly consume_from_id
    - remove the prints from kafkalite class to put them in their own class
    - create a declarative language to query the topics
    - add a volatile topic option
    - create an index alongside the logs

python -m unittest test_kafkalite.py
